K8s in a Nutshell
=================

K8s is a container orchestration tool. Today there are a lot of microservices
architectures. We can have a container per service and managing all those
containers can be hard. K8s takes care of teh scalability, security,
persistence and load balancing.

When k8s is triggered to create a container, it will delegate it to the
container runtime engine via a CRI (container runtime interface)

Features
--------

- Declarative Model
  - the cool thing about k8s, is that you just tell it the status of the
    cluster you want, via yamls, and it will do its best to create it.
- Autoscaling
  - k8s can also automatically (or manually) scale resources when needed.
- Application management 
  - When deploying new versions for your application, you can use k8s to manage
    the roll out technique. As well as come back to previous rollouts
- Persistent Storage
  - Containers are ephemeral, meaning the filesystem in them will die with
    them. With k8s you can have persistent volumes, to manage storage across
    containers.
- Networking
  - k8s has internal and external load balancing for network traffic.


High-Level Architecture
-----------------------

There are two types of nodes (these can be vm, baremetal machines, whatever you
call a computer), two types of nodes:

- control plane nodes
  - this node exposes k8s API thru a server. Whenever you do `kubectl
    something` you are talking to this API.
- worker nodes
  - this are the nodes that execute the workload in containers manged by pods.
  - worth to say that every worker node needs a container runtime engine, to
    create the containers.


Control Plane Nodes
-------------------

These have different components to do their job:
* API Server 
  - Exposes the k8s api to clients (kubectl)
  - Here is where the authentication, authorization and admission control also
    happens.
* Scheduler
  - Background process that watches for new k8s pods with no assigned and look
    for a node to execute them.
* Control Manager
  - Watches the state of your clusters and implements changes where needed.
  - This is the guy that makes the cluster be to its desired state.
* Etcd
  - key-value db that stores all k8s cluster related data.


Components Shared by Nodes
--------------------------

There are some components that are shared by the nodes, whether they are
control or workers.

* Kubelet
  - agent that makes sure the necessary containers are running in a pod.
  - this is the glue between k8s and the container runtime engine.

* Kube Proxy
  - every node has this network proxy to enable network communication and
    implement their rules.

* Container runtime
  - the container runtime that will manage the containers. Not really needed in
    control planes.


Advantages on Using k8s
-----------------------

* Portability
  - the container runtime engine can run stuff regardless of whether you run it
    on a vm, bm or even on a raspberry. So you have portability for your things
    regardless of where the cluster is located.
* Resilience 
  - controllers are always looking to be on the desired state. Meaning it will
    try to self-heal when something goes array.
* Scalability 
  - k8s can scale the number of pods on demand or automatically 
* Extensibility
  - When the core functionality is not enough you can introduce CRDs that
    extend the functionality of the cluster.
