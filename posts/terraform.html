<h2 id='why'>why terraform?</h2>
<p>
First, let me state that it is better to manage a big fleet of servers using
code, you can have version control, which honestly seems to be reason enough to
consider it.
</p>

<p>
Before things like terraform, developers worked with operation teams, to deploy
their code.  This usually was in baremetal systems, where sysadmins had to take
care of installing dependencies, updating packages, deploying software, making
sure all the servers had the same (similarish) configurations, among other
stuff.
</p>

<p>
This caused a lot of issues, since things can get messy real quickly.
Therefore, developers came with the solution, of configuring, deploying and
doing pretty much everything with code. This can be done multiple ways, here I
list a few.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>ad hoc scripts</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You write scripts in your favorite scripting language to install
        programs, update stuff and so on.
      </li>
      <li>
        Better than doing it on the fly, but, still have some issues, for
        example is hard to be consistent on all your scripts,  when multiple
        developers will be working on them.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>configuration management tools</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Stuff like <i>`ansible`</i>, tools that are designed to manage software
        on existing servers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Improvement compared with the ad hoc scripts, since this will be way
        more consistent, not only on your project but on multiple projects on
        different organizations.
      </li>
      <li>
        Other thing that make them a bit better than the ad hoc scripts, is
        that you can manage multiple heards of servers this way. With the ad
        hoc scripts you usually need to ssh to the system and run it or do
        something similar, with ansible you can deploy software in multiple
        servers with one command.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>server templating tools</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Instead of launching a bunch of servers and deploying the software with
        the same script on each. You build an image, and create the servers
        with this image.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you need to update some package or something, you rebuild the image,
        destroy the running server and redeploy.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>provisioning tools</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Here is where <b>terraform</b> comes into the picture. These tools will
        literally create servers themselves.
      </li>
      <li>
        Wait, how would they do that? Are they humans that go to a lab and
        mount a server with their hands? No, they will talk with cloud
        providers APIs and create the resources you need.
      </li>
      <li>
        The neat part about this is that like k8s, they use the declarative
        approach. You declare the status of your infra, and it will create it
        like you have define it. If you have a terraform file that says we need
        to create 10  servers with certain image, and further down the line you
        want to add 5 more. You can change that file to say 15, and terraform
        will take care of just having 15 servers, not 25.
      </li>
      <li>
        Other cool stuff, is version control. You can have this configuration
        files pass through a code review process.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
So why terraform among other tools? Well, the author of the book presents some
good points.
</p>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Domain Specific Language</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        For starters they have a Domain Specific Language. Meaning there is
        this HCL language that you will find in all the terraform config files.
        This is can be beneficial, since some tools use general languages like
        python meaning you lose consistency from project to project.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Masterless</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Do not need a server to keep track of the state, since the <i>"master
        server"</i> is the Cloud Provider itself.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The author make some other points, but this two are enough for me I guess.
